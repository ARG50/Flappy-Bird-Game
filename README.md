# Flappy Bird Game in Java with Swing GUI

This is a simple Flappy Bird game built using **Java** and **Swing GUI**. The game features the classic mechanics of Flappy Bird, where the player controls a bird attempting to avoid pipes and stay in the air by tapping the screen or pressing a key.

## Features

- **Flappy Bird Gameplay:** The bird can be controlled by pressing a key (or tapping the screen) to simulate a flapping motion that keeps the bird in the air.
- **Pipes:** The game features moving pipes that appear at random heights and move from right to left across the screen.
- **Collision Detection:** The bird collides with pipes or the ground, resulting in the end of the game.
- **Background Music and Sound Effects:** (Optional) You can add background music and sound effects for flapping and collisions.

## Requirements

- **Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher** for running the game.
- **Swing Library** (Part of Java SE, no additional setup required).

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
 `git clone https://github.com/ARG50/Flappy-Bird-Game.git`


2. **Navigate to the project folder:**
`cd flappybird-java`


3. **Compile the Java files:**
If you're using a command line, you can compile the Java files with:
`javac FlappyBird.java`


4. **Run the game:**
After compiling, you can run the game by executing:
`java FlappyBird`


## How to Play

- **Control the Bird:** Press the spacebar (or another key depending on your setup) to make the bird "flap" and rise.
- **Avoid Pipes:** The pipes are moving from right to left. You need to avoid colliding with them by flapping the bird.
- **Game Over:** The game ends when the bird collides with a pipe or falls to the ground.

## Game Controls

- **Flap the Bird:** Press the **Spacebar** (or **Enter**) to make the bird flap and rise.

## Game Assets

- **Images:** The game includes image assets for the background, bird, pipes, and other UI elements. These images should be located in the `resources` directory of the project.
- **Sound Effects:** You can add sound effects such as bird flapping, pipe collisions, and background music (optional).

Make sure you have the following image files in your `resources` folder:
- `flappybirdbg.png` - Background image.
- `flappybird.png` - Image for the bird.
- `toppipe.png` - Image for the top pipe.
- `bottompipe.png` - Image for the bottom pipe.

### Troubleshooting

- **Image Not Found:**
Ensure that the image files are located in the correct directory (`resources`) and are being referenced correctly in the code.

- **Game Crashes:**
If you see any crashes, check the console for error messages, which might provide insight into missing resources or other issues.
